File associations
With the *.[extension] pattern you can define custom file icon associations. For example you could define an icon for *.sample and every file that ends with .sample will have the defined icon. However, not all files with the same file extension always have the same icon. For some specific file names there is a special icon. In order to overwrite all the specific file icons as well, two asterisks must be set instead of one, i.e. **.[extension].

If there's no leading * it will be automatically configured as filename and not as file extension.
